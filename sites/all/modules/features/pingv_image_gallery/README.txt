The Image Gallery feature provides two node types. One for galleries and one
for images. The main display /gallery shows a listing of galleries along with
any images not currently associated with a gallery. Clicking on a gallery will
take you to the first image node in the gallery. A block on the right gives you
navigation through the rest of the gallery.

To add a new image, simply use the "Add image" link. If you are currently within
a gallery, the gallery node reference field will be prepopulated. If you are
within a gallery, there will also be a "Edit Gallery" link which will allow you
to rename or reorder images within the gallery.

To add a new gallery, simply click "Add gallery". Give it a name. Images can
only be in one gallery at a time.

By default, comments are enabled on images and only images show in the activity
stream.
